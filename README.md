# Stock-Market-Imitation
**Authors:**  Ryan Chow, Scott Gibson, Colin Harmon, Ryan Leung, Jason Miller


Stock Market Imitation is a web-based simulation of the stock market. Users can participate in trading stocks utilizing virtual currency to see how they perform. This project simulates the top 20 companies from the S&P 500 alongside the S&P 500 index itself.

*Note: This project only uses simulated money, no purchases can be made with official currencies.*

## Features
Users are given an amount of money on login which they can use to invest in any of the companies we simulate. These companies can be found on the *search* page. By going to the *company* page corresponding to these companies, users can see how the company is currently performing and can buy or sell stock in the company.

Users can visit the *portfolio* page to see how their net worth has changed over time, view their transaction history, and check the valuation of the stock they own on a per-stock basis. On this page, users can also edit their profile by changing their name, or uploading a profile picture.

Lastly, we have included a forum page where users can ask questions, lead discussions, or offer advice. On this page, new categories can be added by users, and each has its own page devoted to posts within the category. On this page, any user can create a new post. When viewing a post, users can make comments on the post, or reply to the comments other users have left.
